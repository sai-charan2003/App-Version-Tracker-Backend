# Version Tracker

### What is App Version Tracker?

App Version Tracker is a solution for developers who don’t publish their apps through the Play Store but still need a way to provide updates to users. With the Version Tracker API, you can easily compare your app's local version to the latest version on the server. The service offers a dashboard to manage all app versions, enabling you to update the version number in one place. Once updated, the new version is available to all users—it's that straightforward.

There is a frontend implementation for this in Flutter, which can be found at [App Version Tracker Frontend](https://github.com/sai-charan2003/App-Version-Tracker-Frontend).

You can find all the APIs used in this [documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26771466/2sAY4uDihX).

An Android library for Version Tracker is also available [here](https://github.com/sai-charan2003/Version-Tracker-Android-Library).
